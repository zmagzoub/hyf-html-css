    <h2>Rallying and Racing</h2>

    <p>Ken Blockʼs rally career began in 2005. His skill and car control became quickly apparent and Block aptly nabbed Rookie of the Year that season in the Rally America Championship. Since then, Block has continued to race in the series, racking up numerous overall wins as well as plenty of podium appearances. He’s also accumulated five X Games medals since the start of his career, including most recently taking silver at Global X Games Barcelona RallyCross in 2013. <br><br>In January 2010, Block formed the Monster World Rally Team and signed with Ford to pursue his dreams of racing in the World Rally Championship and in doing so, became one of only four Americans to ever score points in the WRC (more Americans have actually landed on the moon than scored points in the WRC). Additionally, his signing with Ford included campaigning domestically in racing (Global RallyCross Championship, X Games and Rally America), as well as continuing with his Gymkhana driving. In 2012, Block re-named his team Hoonigan Racing Division, with the goal to further push the boundaries of motorsports marketing. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, Block dedicated himself to competing in the Global Rallycross Championship, finishing second overall in 2015. <br><br>For the 2016 and 2017 race seasons, Block moved to racing full-time in the FIA World Rallycross Championship as well as competing at the Gymkhana GRID finals in the fall and creating multiple, special video projects.</p>
    
    <h2>Gymkhana</h2>
  
    <p>Block has achieved a global fame as a rally driver through his wildly successful viral Gymkhana series of videos. With all nine of his Gymkhana videos (plus all associated edits) clocking in at over 500 million views on the franchise in total, they have helped put Block in front of eyeballs around the world.</p>

    <p id="car11"><span class="blue">2016 Ford Focus RS RX #43</span><br> The Focus RS build is a global collaboration between Ford Performance, Block’s Hoonigan Racing Division and U.K.-based M-Sport. Featuring all-wheel drive, a new EcoBoost® engine producing 600 horsepower, and a 0-60 mph launch time of less than two seconds, the Ford Focus RS RX is optimized for rallycross competition.<p>

It was also Block’s Gymkhana SIX and Gymkhana EIGHT picture car. RX43 is optimized for massive torque, off-the-line launching ability and is highly competitive in rallycross competitions. For FIA World Rallycross in 2014, and because RX43 was tied up with national events, M-Sport assembled an identical car that was called RX43B. Setup (suspension, differentials, engine maps, etc) is tuned to each individual event.</p>

Taking that car that starred in Gymkhana SEVEN, Block and his team have modified the 410 cubic inch Roush Yates Ford V8 heart of the Hoonicorn to now feature a custom twin turbo setup from Garrett that feeds the boost through a custom Switzer Dynamics intake manifold. The end result? 1,400 horsepower that's fed through the Sadev all wheel-drive system. Designed from the start to take a car that was already crazy and make it absolutely insane, Block has done so. Now the Hoonicorn V2 gets ready for its next video project.</p>
